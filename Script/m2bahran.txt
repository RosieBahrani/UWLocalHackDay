Autonomous vehicles have been a topic of research for the past decade. University of Waterloo’s WAVE Lab researches on improvement of autonomous vehicles. Rollen and Jake’s FYDP aimed to further research possible improvements in this area. For that purpose, their project included three main sections. First, the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). This feature aims to maintain or modify the speed of the moving vehicle depending on the occurrences in its environment. For example, if another vehicle stops in front, the moving car need to decelerate in order to avoid any collisions. Second, Rollen and Jake implemented the feature of Lane Keeping Assist (LKA). They used image processing to identify the lanes on a road and used angle calculations to find the curve of the road. The purpose of this feature is to push the car back into its lane, in case the car is deviated from its lane. Third, they developed a bridge between the two software that they used: PreScan and ROS. Since PreScan only runs on Windows and ROS only runs on Linux, they had to use two different operating systems on two different computers and connect the two simulation software.
